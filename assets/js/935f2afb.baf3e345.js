In addition to standard data retrieval and mutations, this architecture also focuses on easily enabling cross-node communication and distributed real time data synchronization. SQL Server serves as the underlying storage mechanism through Entity Framework. SignalR is used for real time data synchronization.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"tutorial":{"id":"tutorial","title":"Tutorial","description":"The details for this guide are still being written","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"walkthrough":{"id":"walkthrough","title":"Walkthrough","description":"The nodes and apps built out in this repository are intended to demonstrate the real-time, cross-node data synchronization patterns enabled by the underlying libraries that they are built upon. The sections that follow will walk through the scenarios that demonstrate these patterns and highlight some of the infrastructure that enables the associated functionality.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}')}}]);
