# Distributed Design

> Design in progress. See [Notes](./notes.md)

The intent of this repository is to identify ways of alleviating pain points associated with developing a monolithic on-premise application. One of the goals of this architecture is to take as few dependencies on external services as possible. All backend services are written with standard .NET APIs with SQL Server as the underlying data store.
